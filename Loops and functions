#Review of Last time:

#Make a program that will take a password from the console and prompt "Enter your password", and a name and prompt "Enter your name" (use the input() function). Then, using an if statement, if the password is "scrantonprep" (Use the == operator) print "Welcome back, (name)" If not, print a rejection statement. Remeber you can store your inputs in variables.

#Make a program that will prompt and take a username and password from the console. If the username is "bob" AND the password is "scrantonprep", print a secret message (Use the and operator in the if statement, or nest an if statement). If not, print a rejection statement.

#(This is an AP Computer Science question, so don't judge)Given the variable prettiness, if prettiness is greather than or equal to 8 (Use the >= operator), print "Yes". If the pretiness is equal to 7, print "Maybe" (TIP: should use the elif operator). If it is less than or equal to 6 (Use the <= operator), print "No".

#Now:
#Tell them to print Hi 5 times
print("Hi")
print("Hi")
print("Hi")
print("Hi")
print("Hi")

#Now for loop:
for i in range(5):
  print("Hi")

#Give an exercise? Make a program that will ask for a name and display "Hello, (name)" 20 times.

#Go over i
for i in range(5):
  print(i)

#While loop- for for loops, you know how many times you loop. With while loops, you don't know how many times you loop.
